    "customerReview": "Loved it. This is a dream swim suit for a hijabi. The fact that it comes with a cap is such a relief. Because of this i was able to do fun in my Maldives trip. I took 1 star off because length of the shirt is a bit short for a hijabi so the thighs with tights are visible. I paid for the fast delivery and got it in 4 days. \r\n"

    "customerReview": "They had a pop up stall at a event. They had a pop up stall at a event I went to. Wasn't a huge stall but then again all the other stall holders had similar sizes. They did have racks of abayas with different abaya styles and colours. Since theres lots of sizes i saw it was getting a little hectic with the amount of people asking for their sizes but I did manage to buy myself a floral embroidered abaya for Â£25. I could see they were lowering prices when someone asked so make sure to ask for a discount if you visit their stalls. Lovely staff members too.\r\n"
